## Registration
First, we use the dark line detection algorithm to get alpha (the chip is often placed with an angle (alpha) when experimenter using microscope taking images). By comparing the interval between the line on the chip and the corresponding interval on the image, the parameter s will be determined. Second, the algorithm will find the center of gravity (i0 and g0) of the image and the expression matrix, align the center of gravity, move the image in the area near the center of gravity and flip (flip horizontally and not flip sequentially) and rotate (0째, 90째, 180째, and 270째 in clockwise direction). The algorithm will use hash algorithm to calculate the Hamming distance. The smallest distance corresponding parameters will be used as the final registration parameters. We use the dark line which is in specific arrangement on the chip as moving unit to ensure the accuracy of the registration.
